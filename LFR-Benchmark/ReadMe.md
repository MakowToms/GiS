# Explanation for Benchmark in 2009
## Code Description
- Package 1 includes the code to generate undirected and unweighted graphs with overlapping communities. The extent of the overlap can be tuned by input, and it can be set to zero if one is interested in non-overlapping clusters.  

- Package 2 includes the code to generate undirected  weighted graphs with possibly overlapping communities.  

- Package 3 includes the code to generate directed unweighted graphs with possibly overlapping communities.  

- Package 4 includes the code to generate directed weighted graphs with possibly overlapping communities.  

- Package 5 includes the code to generate the hierarchical benchmarks, with communities inside other communities.  

The code is written in C++. In each package there is a Readme file where you can find instructions on how to use the code and simple examples.
